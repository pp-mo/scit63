                **NEED** for cartopy
    
    Packed PP
        The libmo_unpack library can be used by Iris for decoding/unpacking PP files or Fields files that use an lbpack value of 1 or 4. 
        This library is open source, licensed under the 2-clause BSD licence. It can be obtained from http://puma.nerc.ac.uk/trac/UM_TOOLS/wiki/unpack.
        Use of this library is not enabled by default. If this library is available its use can be enabled by installing Iris with the following command:
          python setup.py --with-unpack install
        Note that if this library and/or its associated header files are installed in a custom location 
        then additional compiler arguments may need to be passed in 
        to ensure that the Python extension module linking against it builds correctly:
        python setup.py --with-unpack build_ext -I <custom include dir> \ 
              -L <custom link-time libdir> -R <custom runtime libdir> install

NOTE: 20130109 - Andy says 
  * not to worry about anything PP (including unpacks) for now
  * do worry about 'sensible' usage: various stuff effectively **is** "required"
      --> basemap(for now), grib-api, matplotlib, mock(for tests), PIL, shapely
      leave out (for now) ? == basemap(when poss), graphviz, nose

20130110
got first test install/upload 'iris-distribution-test' package working from PyPI
    - plain setuptools, using setup.py only
    - "pip install" works in a virtual env

Thinking about dependencies.  Advice is
    *essential* dependencies can be captured in setup.py with setup() "install_requires" options
        - but these are *inflexible*, so should only specify broadly what is needed
    pip adds a 'requirements file' that has finer granularity
        - including 'recommended' as well as 'required'

Asked Andy about permissions
  (procedural as in "haven't had permission", and practical as in "won't let me")
  should be procedurally ok : won't be getting anything we haven't already approved
  practically, if have any problems can use dirty laptop + external net (yellow cable)

Ed says we don't need to consider system libraries at present

Thinking about install scripts
  Ed's for OS-X
    copy at : /net/home/h05/itpp/Iris/sprints/sprint_20130107/SCIT63_install_pip/esc24_OSX_install_20130110.txt
  Byron's originally for Ubuntu --> towards Travis-CI  (has become a .yml, still much like the Ubuntu install script but now enhanced)
    copy at : /net/home/h05/itpp/Iris/sprints/sprint_20130107/SCIT63_install_pip/bblay_travis_20130110.yml


Looking at Ed's, questions arise
  - why instructions, not actual script?  (seems mostly close)
  - why 'sudo python setup.py' --i.e. why the "sudo" ??
  - why "vi) Add .pth file to virtualenv's site-packages so that 'import gribapi' works" 
      --i.e. why can't we actually "setup.py install" it ?

NOTE: grib-install problem noted on GG/Iris-Dev by bb :
  -- https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scitools-iris-dev/KQRz28JhBCc
  -- """
       they've changed the install procedure ...
       they've changed the folder name from *gribapi* to *grib_api*
       we need to make a softlink now because *setup.py* has been removed
     """

Looking into prerequisites
  "pip install numpy" seems to work ""sometimes"" ?
  "pip install scipy" now also apparently working  -- BUT REQUIRES numpy (must do first)


20130111
tried to DRY the Iris version, but every method seems to have problems
  -- 'fixed' for distrib-test-2, but requires to import the target module.
    -- this is not desirable, for a number of reasons !

problems with process..
    something is caching the downloads, so we have a problem with updating things
      - upgrading version is not itself enough?
      - Have been creating new PyPI projects (Iris, Iris1, Iris2 ...)
    pip install runs downloaded setup.py "egg_info" for dependencies
     - often has unresolved dependencies : problems because you don't install stuff till *after* (!!)
        - e.g. original Iris setup.py imports numpy and nose --> fail to install  ((NOW FIXED...))
        - more seriously, now find that scipy install ***requires numpy***
===> arrghh!


20130114
confirmed that 'pip install scipy' itself does not work due to Numpy dependence within setup.py
 == RATS!
followed up with web-search (+ StackOverflow in particular)

Versions...
  we currently have scipy 0.10, which *** did not have this problem *** (you can install it in one)
   -- but they advise in any case that you DO NOT build from source unless you have a real need
 scipy 0.10 requires numpy >= 1.4.1
 scipy 0.11 requires numpy >= 1.5.0
 ( we have "assumed" Iris needs scipy >= 0.10.0, only because that is what we have )

0.11 was released last September
 we presumably have not tested with latest versions ?
-->  discussed with Ed, who says stick to our current declarations in Installer guide:
  = numpy > 0.1
  = scipy > 

The problem of setup dependencies is known + stalled (~ 1 year)
  http://projects.scipy.org/scipy/ticket/1429
    :  SciPy think this is pip problem + will not change to resolve
  https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/25
    :  Pip admits there is a problem but no proposals to fix
    :  problem relates to USE of setup.py to establish dependencies
      - apparently, setuptools/distutils works this way + that is it for now
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11797688/matplotlib-requirements-with-pip-install-in-virtualenv
    : similar problem installing matplotlib



conclusions
  - can only be "solved" by fixing scipy itself (issue exists ="will not fix")
  - few complaints resulting, since release in September
  - no-one really expects this to "just work" anyway ??
  - THEY RECOMMEND that you do not build it anyway (SciPy "INSTALL.TXT")

things to do
  retain upload-to-PyPI requirement
  resolve the minimum dependency problems for an install
  revise installation instructions
  ?? same for cartopy ??
  

NEXT...
install numpy + try again.  scipy now installs ok.  Iris still fails...

now looks like Iris will install, but falls over because (Iris)setup.py install
depends on **pyke**

-- also avoided (??for now??)

Having got nump+scipy, "install Iris5" now fails on NetCDF4
  -- see /home/h05/itpp/Iris/sprints/sprint_20130107/SCIT63_install_pip/install_output_20130114_1653.txt
  -- seems to find the netCDF4 library dir, but not the includes
  -- presumably because the MOSciTools install (rpm) is non-dev ?
  -- download to ~/nchdrs + "export NETCDF4_DIR=/home/h05/itpp/nchdrs"
      --> WORKS !

** ? SHOULD BE OK IN 'REAL' (where user has installed netCDF4 libs themself)

uninstall and re-try in the main env with this settings...
 --> /home/h05/itpp/Iris/sprints/sprint_20130107/SCIT63_install_pip/install_output_20130114_1747.txt
 --> "pyke" problem again ...

read up on install_requires/setup_requires meaning + added setup_requires including Pyke
tried then re-implement NETCDF4_DIR
tried again, need to fix project name again
re-pip "install Iris6"
  --> /home/h05/itpp/Iris/sprints/sprint_20130107/SCIT63_install_pip/install_output_20130115_1049.txt

Now sticks because "netcdftime" is needed
 -- ??is this part of netCDF4 ??
   -- trying eval in separate env : NOTE netCDF4 ***ALSO*** requires numpy
      -- (so will still need that)
      -- yes, that comes with netCDF4

VERSION 7 : include netCDF in 'setup_requires'
  -->  /home/h05/itpp/Iris/sprints/sprint_20130107/SCIT63_install_pip/install_output_20130115_1108.txt
This fails executing "tools/generate_std_names.py etc/cf-standard-name-table.xml build/lib/iris/std_names.py"
  -- doing the generate-standard-names ?
  -- not clear why (to me)


start new install with all pre-requisites to investigate Iris install
  -- intending to use **manual** install, for speed..
: make ~/py_envs/tmpall
: pip install..
    numpy
    scipy
    Pyrex  ****NOTE: needed when installing netCDF4 ****
      -- Don't think previous version did that
      -- our exisiting is  : 0.9.9  == Dec 2011
      -- latest is         : 1.0.2  == Nov 21 2012
    netCDF4 (don't forget the NETCDF4_DIR !)
    pyke
: now try to download + install the lot...
    - mkdir dist_i7
    - cd dist_i7
    - tar -xf /home/h05/itpp/git/iris/iris_main/dist/Iris7\-1.99.0\-xdistrev2.tar.g
    - cd ..
    - bin/pip install dist_i7/Iris7\-1.99.0\-xdistrev2/

It has now actually **INSTALLED** nose, pshp, shapely, mock
But failed to complete on Iris(7) itself, just as previously

It looks from traceback that the basic problem is locating udunits2
 -- Phil suggests this won't be a problem if this is installed 'normally'
So try..
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/sci/lib/libudunits2.so:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  -- does not work : ctypes.utils.find_library does not use this

Can't find an os-generic workaround for this, or in fact any workaround at all
JUST FOR NOW: tweak code to read an environment setting UDUNITS2_PATH
 - this tweak is only temporary, and **MUST NOT** go into master

Now find that we need cartopy...
enabled a local build with a PYTHONPATH setting
  - export PYTHONPATH= 
  - rebuild using current "make.sh", which links to Ed's proj4
  - this can't be used for standard install (but that should be ok??)

**** NOW IT INSTALLS !! ****

Ideally, we would also download+build Cartopy
 -- it only needs doing alongside, 


STILL TO-DO
    put Cartopy itself must exist on PyPI
    make cartopy a setup_requires
    ?? enable install_requires for matplotlib and grib-api ??

grib_api is a further problem, as it is external
  FOR NOW: 
    cd ve-dir/lib/python2.7/site-packages
    ln -s ln -s /usr/local/sci/lib/python2.7/site\-packages/grib_api/ .
    echo grib_api >./gribapi.pth

Other Settings reminders ..
    (tmpall)itpp@eld238: /net/home/h05/itpp/py_envs/tmpall > echo $NETCDF4_DIR 
    /home/h05/itpp/nchdrs
    (tmpall)itpp@eld238: /net/home/h05/itpp/py_envs/tmpall > echo $UDUNITS2_PATH 
    /usr/local/sci/lib/libudunits2.so

NOTE FOR NOW - cartopy is also 'assumed'
  - we also have to leave it OUT of the install/setup_requires,
    as it has no PyPI presence (I presume)
  - though it is still NEEDED to install (to load iris, to build std_names)

Install now goes like this...
    bin/pip install dist_i7/Iris7\-1.99.0\-xdistrev2.tar.gz
      ...
    Successfully installed nose pyshp shapely mock pyke Iris7

Tests won't run unless we install matplotlib...

running tests as "cd ~/git/iris/iris_main; python setup.py test"
  -- NB now provided by "nose".  Not sure of the interface now.

Only 1 fails, but this implies we are missing "pyproj"
  -- it is not Cartopy that needs this, by iris.analysis.cartography !!

NEXT-TO-DO : 
  add in this dependency
  are there more?
    - ?? checkout all installed for current SciTools
  any missing package data ?
    - compare install with standard setup

  check auto-install for matplotlib


20130116
remaining probs
---------------
review the whole install process from fresh on laptop
?? What about 'pip install Cartopy' ??
see about 'extras' : 
  nothing in setuptools(Distribute) for normally-does-but-can-exclude ?
  - means we may have to *insist* on matlotlib, gribapi etc
netCDF4 needs Pyrex (to install)
  - that may mean we can't do this automatically after all ?


Now checking Cartopy pip-install
  install depends on Cython
    -- tried making this 'optional', 
    claims to install Cython, but then fails on this anyway??
    -- tried using setuptools version if import fails : still no go


20130117
Found last night that "setup.py install" fails under pip but not directly.
Seems to be a problem with setuptools, in that it is somehow messing up the
Cython version of build_ext
***Seems to be fixed by installing "distribute"***
  (which patches setuptools, I think?)
Can't make this go on own machine because it doesn't find proj4
  -- the PROJ_DIR method only works on pyproj, which we are ***about to lose***
      -- see https://github.com/SciTools/iris/pull/313
  -- otherwise, -I/-L etc, only available to "build_ext" (not build/install)

Possible solutions
  - include "distribute"
     - 'distribute' project suggests you can auto-enable it.  
       - Not tested, not sure this is a good plan.
  - enforce 'setup.py build_ext' first (i.e. doesn't go through pip)
  - distribute c files + don't use Cython (or distribute) for source build
     - neater, but potentially awkward?
  - like previous, but require Cython + pre-compile in the setup pass.
     - not clear what to hook.
     - maybe provide *own* (subclass) build_ext, in place of Cython one ?

Philip asked "why use setuptools instead of distutils?"
  -- have used various setup args not supported by "bare" distutils :
        setup_requires / install_requires / tests_require
  -- with "use_setuptools = False" ...

         ...

Requiring **any** of setuptools/distribute/distribute2 is a problem ??
  -- the extra args can be made selectable, seeing if setuptools is imported ?


20130118
--------
Found that a *subsequent* "import setuptools" is sufficient to avoid
warnings about setuptools-specific extension args to 'setup()'
Presumably, this is the "monkey patch" in operation.

Questioned Phil about his "don't use setuptools" remark
  - inconclusive, he wasn't sure 
  - except there is nasty stuff in there "somewhere"
My understanding is that we *need* setuptools-level features (at least) to 

We have setuptools, but not pip/virtualenv
We don't have distribute/distutils2

If we assume pip, we have setuptools (which pip uses).
But, we (probably) shouldn't *assume* setuptools in the setup.py itself
  -- can we fix this to be bare-disutils compliant ??


From yesterday's reading, pip *only* does source distribution, 
whereas setuptools (and distutils) do binary-distribution, too.
An interesting article about what was (in retrospect) 
- right with setuptools
- wrong with pip
  -- http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2012/6/22/hate-hate-hate-everywhere
A list of "issues" from this
  - the monkey-patch issue (what + why)
  - pth and eggs
  - binary distributions
  - Windows installers support
  - partwise distributions (i.e. semi-independence of project *areas*)
  - naming reuse vagueness (PyPI/Python "package"s, "eggs" = info, folders, tars/zips)
  - relocatability of virtualenvs (originally in, but broken ?)


========================
PACKAGING ISSUES SUMMARY
========================

What is wrong with distutils (SETUP.PY) ???
  - no requirements chaining
  - documentation lacks overviews
    - explains some things, but not the 'set' of features available
    - e.g. http://docs.python.org/2/distutils/commandref.html#installing-modules-the-install-command-family
      - this is just laughable
    - what are the commands?
      is the command-line help definitive?
      what does it all mean ?
      is there a decent overview somewhere ?
What is right with distutils (SETUP.PY) ???
  - reliable
  - absolutely basic standard
  - PyPI with upload

What is wrong with setuptools (EASY_INSTALL, PTHs, EGGs) ???
  - too clever, has unexpected behaviour + effects
  - incomplete documentation, can only be understood with distutils knowledge
  - a simple list of the concepts/stage/commands is nowhere given
    - no clear statement of "how" it works + what can be achieved
    - no statements of what "X" does in terms of invoking other things
    - no sourcecode visibility either
      - (unlike e.g. "make", where you can see what is programmed)
    - not even definitive statements of what it does cover
      - e.g. what is "build_ext"
  - 'tests' means unittest only
  - invasive behaviour of self-installing builds
What is right with setuptools ???
  - metadata + dependencies
  - package data management
  - powerful extendable design
  - Pyrex (?? ~= Cython) support  --but is this actually bugged ?? (--> distribute)
  - PyPI supports it
  

What is wrong with PiP ???
  - not a standard item (though that doesn't specifically bother us here)
  - doesn't do binarys or Windows installers
  - the only documentation seems to be hopelessly out-of-date
      - so the HHGTP reference doesn't tally with what it says ?
        - e.g. "list" command does not exist, this seems to be "freeze"
        - e.g. "show" command does not exist
        - e.g. "search" seems not to work at all?
      - no explanation of how it will call setuptools (etc.)
What is right with PiP ???
  - simplified download+install
  - modules list allows uninstall+upgrade
  - (supposedly?) supports svn/git/etc


It seems pip is the only "simple" solution, 
  which includes fixing the requirements
  but will need a set of prior requirements resolving
    - mostly system libraries (platform specific)
      - netCDF4
      - udunits2
      - numpy (or scipy)
      - grib_api ??
      - setuptools ??
    - a few Python issues
       - link to gribapi
       - pre-installs
          - numpy
          - Pyrex (for netCDF4 install)
          - netCDF4 (for dev headers)
          - distribute (?for Cython)
          - Cython (for Cartopy  == POSSIBLY NOT? : to test)

optionals...
  gribapi
  mpl
  PIL
  nose
  mock


Python3 support
  distutils supported
  setuptools not supported
    -- replaced with distribute
  pip supported



===================
PROBLEMS ADDRESSED - LIST
===================
List of (specific) things we've had problems with ...

github hosted release       : unachievable/unwise : host releases separately

pip + scipy                 : unavoidably requires numpy (scipy recommends binary anyway?)
netCDF4 needs headers
netCDF4 (most recent) needs Pyrex (aka Cython-as-was??)
gribapi needs .pth
Cython + setuptools         : require "distribute" to fix Cartopy install


(non-essentials?)
----------------
options                     : can't do in/out options e.g. "--no-grib"
gribapi installation        : needs .pth, not clear how we make this clearer?

pyproj -- (should be gone if merge Carwyn's fix)


possible still-unresolved ...
-----------------------
possible Cython/Pyrex collision on install for netCDF4/Cartopy ??
possibly can get away with including Cython as setup_requires on Cartopy
  (given "distribute" is included)


=======================
RESULT SUMMARY  ((current belief status))
=========================

* various system intalls must be present first
    netCDF4 (underlying libraries **AND** includes - i.e. '-dev' version)
    udunits2
    proj4
    gribapi
      -- how do we link this in?
      -- must be possible to 'install' this into Python too

* numpy must be pre-installed

* ??for non-standard installs, various environment variables must be set??
    for netcdf/udunits location
    for proj4 to netcdf (??but maybe not??)

* you can then just do "pip install Iris"


=============
DELIVERY
============
Document prior installs to where you can 'just' type "pip install Iris".
Setup new Scitools PyPI id
Document release process for new version


===========================
USEFUL NOTES? ::
  use "pip install --timeout 120 <package>" to overcome timeouts
    -- use REPEATEDLY, seems to cache parts + eventually work ?
